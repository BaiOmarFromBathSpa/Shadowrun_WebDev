            <h2>Books</h2>
            There is a long, rich history of Shadowrun books still available in e-book and print forms. While some rulebooks may no longer apply, the vast majority of the sourcebooks published for Shadowrun are still relevant.
            
            To immerse you into the awful world of shadowrun, The different categories of books are listed below to peruse at your own (p)leisure. (I am only familiar with the novels so content ahead is directly sourced from Catalyst Games and not-so-neatly adapted here, beware poor grammer)

            Getting Started
            If you’re new to Shadowrun, dive into the free Quick-Start Rules PDF to get a quick taste of the universe and rules of the tabletop version. Once you’ve wetted your appetite, the Fifth Edition Rulebook is the single source you need to dive into all the action, intrigue and magic of all the Sixth World has to offer.

            Core Rulebooks
            These Core Rulebooks expand on the various aspects found in the previous Fourth Edition Rulebook, providing a plethora of options: more guns, vehicles, and drones; more cyberware, bioware and new nanotechnology; more magic and the metaplanes; new hacking tricks and sprites; more character optio. Plus a host of optional rules for any character type. Catalyst Games may publish new core rulebooks supporting Fifth Edition in the future.

            Fiction
            Fiction has always played a seminal part in developing and fleshing-out the Shadowrun universe, from short fiction in sourcebooks, to full-length novels; nothing works as well to immerse a player into the Sixth World. Catalyst Game Labs is releasing brand new fiction, while also starting to make available all previously published novels in epub format.
            
            The fictional book were created by formerly FASA and currently (Wizkids?) I only have reading experience with the formerly, more specifically the Secrets of Power trilogy by (Robert N Charette?) I have read Mercy Strret, a new shorter novel and it read well so... yeah.

            Out-Of-Print Books
            With twenty years of history, Shadowrun has dozens and dozens of rulebooks, sourcebooks, and adventures that are long out of print. While many of those books have updated versions currently in print, for long years most of that material simply was unobtainable. Now those books are once more available, in PDF format, for use by any player or gamemaster.</p>
