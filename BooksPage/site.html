            <h2>Shadowrun Books</h2>
            <p>There is a long, rich history of Shadowrun books still available
                in e-book and print forms. While some rulebooks may no longer
                apply, the vast majority of the sourcebooks published for
                Shadowrun are still relevant.</p>
            <p>To immerse you into the awful world of shadowrun, The different
                categories of books are listed below to peruse at your own
                (p)leisure. (I am only familiar with the novels so content ahead
                is directly sourced from Catalyst Games and not-so-neatly
                adapted here, beware poor grammer)</p>

                PDF to get a quick taste of the universe and rules of the
                tabletop version. Once you’ve wetted your appetite, the Fifth
                Edition Rulebook is the single source you need to dive into all

            <p>The Shadowrun universe is vast, with a depth that’s compelling
                and immersive. Core Supplements expand various aspects of the
                universe, whether it’s the core setting location of Seattle, the

                what’s like to walk the streets out of the shadows, and more.</p>
            <h3>Deep Shadows Sourcebooks</h3>

            <h3>Setting Sourcebooks</h3>
            <p>Though Seattle is the primary location of Shadowrun, the world is
                large, with a hundred sprawls and and just as many corporations
                spreading shadows where a runner can find work. Setting
                Sourcebooks flesh-out the details for cities and countries
                around the globe, offering additional locals for the team eager
                to see what’s in the shadows over there.</p>

            <h3>Plot Sourcebooks</h3>
            <p>The Shadowrun universe is not static. Instead, it’s a dynamic,
                changing universe, with a host of plot threads of intrigue that
                weave through-out the Sixth World. Plot Sourcebooks expand upon
                existing threads or introduce new threads, pushing the universe
                forward and providing players with new and exciting concepts for
                their campaigns.</p>

                information, and plot points needed for gamemasters to take
                players through exciting runs; the specifics details of what

            <h3>Fiction</h3>
            <p>Fiction has always played a seminal part in developing and
                fleshing-out the Shadowrun universe, from short fiction in
                sourcebooks, to full-length novels; nothing works as well to
                immerse a player into the Sixth World. Catalyst Game Labs is
                releasing brand new fiction, while also starting to make
                available all previously published novels in epub format.</p>
            <p>The fictional book were created by formerly FASA and currently

                specifically the Secrets of Power trilogy by (Robert N
                Charette?) I have read Mercy Strret, a new shorter novel and it
                read well so... yeah if you wanna know where to start click on <a href="#">one of these images.</a></p>

            <h3>Out-Of-Print Books</h3>
            <p>With twenty years of history, Shadowrun has dozens and dozens of
                rulebooks, sourcebooks, and adventures that are long out of
                print. While many of those books have updated versions currently
                in print, for long years most of that material simply was
                unobtainable. Now those books are once more available, in PDF
                format, for use by any player or gamemaster.</p>
