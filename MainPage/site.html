                <p>The end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ushered in the
                    "Sixth World", with once-mythological beings (e.g. dragons, ghouls and worse)
                    appearing and forms of magic suddenly emerging. Large numbers of
                    humans have "Goblinized" into orks and trolls, while many human
                    children are born as elves, dwarves, and even more exotic
                    creatures. Basically Magic, Neon and Cool ### Cybernetics</p>
                <p>...and hypercapitalism and other bad stuff we will promptly
                    ignore.</p>
                <p>Instead lets talk about the things that truly make Shadowrun -
