        <h3>1993 - Shadowrun</h3>
        <p>Shadowrun is a cyberpunk-fantasy action role-playing video game
            for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, adapted from the
            tabletop role-playing game Shadowrun by FASA. The video game was
            developed by Australian company Beam Software and first released
            in 1993 by Data East.</p>
        <p>The game is loosely based on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon
            by Shadowrun co-creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year
            2050. The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a man
            suffering from amnesia after having been critically wounded by
            assassins. The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover
            his own identity and the identity of the mysterious figure who
            wants him dead, and eventually complete his mission. Harebrained
            Schemes' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the stories of this game
            and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis.</p>

        <h3>1994 - Shadowrun</h3>
        <p>Shadowrun is an action role-playing game for the Sega Genesis,
            released in 1994 in North America and Asia only. It was adapted
            from the cyberpunk role-playing game Shadowrun by FASA, and was
            developed by BlueSky Software. The game is the second video game
            adapted from Shadowrun, and has a more open ended style of
            gameplay than its 1993 Super NES counterpart, Shadowrun by Beam
            Software.</p>
        <p>Shadowrun offers the player an open style of gameplay, where one
            controls the main character, Joshua, in a top-down third person
            perspective during both exploration and combat. Battles are real
            time, and although of varying difficulty, tend to be relatively
            short. Initially, the player is restricted to a single area of
            the game, but shortly gains access to almost all other areas.
            Access to other areas is accomplished primarily by taxi,
            although various restrictions and other modes of travel also
            exist, such as requiring a visa or bypassing the visa check with
            the use of a helicopter.</p>

        <h3>1996 - Shadowrun</h3>
        <p>Shadowrun (シャドウラン, Shadouran) is a cyberpunk visual novel
            role-playing video game for the Sega Mega-CD adapted from the
            Japanese version of the pen and paper RPG Shadowrun by FASA
            (which was created by Group SNE). It was developed by Japanese
            company Compile and released on February 23, 1996 in Japan
            only as both the last Mega-CD game released in Japan and the
            last game released anywhere on the Mega-CD/Sega CD.</p>
        <p>The game has a 1990s manga-based visual style loosely based on a
            contemporary Japanese manga series which was based on the
            Shadowrun franchise. Unlike the other Shadowrun video games
            which are set in Seattle and surrounding areas, this game is set
            entirely in Japan. In the fictional Shadowrun setting, Japan
            maintains a practice of exiling all orcs and trolls; thus there
            are no characters of those races in this game. The combat system
            is turn-based, and six-sided dice appear rolling on the screen
            determine the results of combat—the conflict resolution system
            used in the Shadowrun table-top game.</p>

        <h3>2007 - Shadowrun</h3>
        <p>Shadowrun is a first-person shooter video game, developed by FASA
            Studio for Xbox 360 and Windows Vista. The game features a
            buying system which is inspired by the game Counter-Strike. The
            game is also inspired by the role-playing game of the same name.</p>
        <p>Shadowrun's multiplayer consisted wholly of a first person/third
            person deathmatch. Players chose various races with unique
            abilities. Additionally, a currency system dictated in-match
            upgrades, with each race given a different amount of starting
            capital. The four playable races are Human, Elf, Dwarf, and
            Troll. Magic was a key component to this game as well. Players
            could heal, damage, teleport, and summon to gain advantages over
            others. Additionally, gadgets, or "tech", were obtainable
            through currency. Currency also allowed players to purchase new
            weapons.</p>
        <p>Shadowrun featured no campaign mode. If a user was without online
            services, they could set up bot matches and hone their skills.</p>

        <h3>2013 - Shadowrun Returns</h3>
        <p>Shadowrun Returns is a tactical role-playing game developed and
            published by Harebrained Schemes. It takes place in the science
            fantasy setting of the Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game. The
            game was crowd funded through Kickstarter and released for
            Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android in 2013.</p>
        <p>An expansion pack titled Shadowrun: Dragonfall, was released in
            2014. It was later converted to a standalone release, Shadowrun:
            Dragonfall - Director's Cut. In 2015, Harebrained Schemes
            launched another Kickstarter campaign to partially fund their
            next game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong. Similar to the Dragonfall -
            Director's Cut edition, Hong Kong was released in 2015 as a
            standalone release built using an upgraded version of the
            Shadowrun Returns engine. A remastered compilation game
            including Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun Dragonfall: Director's
            Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, is released on Windows, Nintendo
            Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
            X/S on June 21, 2022.</p>
        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        <p>The player can customize their character's gender and appearance.
            There are five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves,
            orcs, and trolls. The game lacks traditional character classes,
            but players may optionally play as one of six pregenerated
            archetypes: street samurai, cybernetically-enhanced warriors who
            focus on weapon mastery; the spell-casting mages; deckers, who
            focus primarily on computer hacking; shamans, who summon spirits
            to assist them in battle; riggers, who control mechanical
            drones; and physical adepts, who are magically-enhanced monks.</p>
        <p>As the story progresses, the player is given character points,
            known as "karma", to spend on improving their characters. If the
            player chose an archetype, it controls what skills and equipment
            the character starts with, but any character can gain any skill
            (e.g., deckers can spend karma to gain a shaman's summoning
            abilities). Besides the player character, up to three other
            characters can be hired during missions. Some
            non-player-characters are required during certain missions.</p>

        <h3>2014 - Shadowrun: Dragonfall</h3>
        <p>Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a tactical role-playing game developed
            by Harebrained Schemes set in the Shadowrun universe. It was
            originally released as downloadable content for Shadowrun
            Returns in February 2014. An expanded version was later released
            as a standalone game in September 2014, under the title
            Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut. A remastered compilation
            game titled Shadowrun Trilogy that includes Shadowrun Returns,
            Shadowrun Dragonfall: Director's Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong,
            launched on Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation
            5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on June 21, 2022.</p>
        <p>Like Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall uses point-based character
            creation, a classless system, and turn-based tactics. Players
            can hire mercenaries to assist them during missions as in the
            previous game, but the player is a part of a preexisting team,
            and these characters are always available. The Directors Cut
            adds optional missions to assist your teammates.</p>

        <h3>2015 - Shadowrun: Hong Kong</h3>
        <p>Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a turn-based tactical role-playing video
            game set in the Shadowrun universe. It was developed and
            published by Harebrained Schemes, who previously developed
            Shadowrun Returns and its standalone expansion, Shadowrun:
            Dragonfall - Director's Cut. It includes a new single-player
            campaign and also shipped with a level editor that lets players
            create their own Shadowrun campaigns and share them with other
            players.</p>
        <p>In January 2015, Harebrained Schemes launched a Kickstarter
            campaign in order to fund additional features and content they
            wanted to add to the game, but determined would not have been
            possible with their current budget. The initial funding goal
            of US$100,000 was met in only a few hours. The campaign ended
            the following month, receiving over $1.2 million.</p>
        <p>The game is set in 2056, within the Hong Kong Free Enterprise
            Zone, a city which is effectively controlled directly by the
            corporations. Unlike the previous games, the player has a
            backstory tied to other characters. The player was once an
            orphan on the streets of Seattle, along with their foster
            brother Duncan, when they were adopted by a man known as Raymond
            Black. However, the player became estranged from Raymond and
            Duncan after getting arrested and sent to a corporate prison
            eight years before the events of the game. After being released,
            the player gets a message from Raymond requesting that they and
            Duncan meet him in Hong Kong</p>
