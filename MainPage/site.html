                <p>Hey <strong title="Friend, Pal, Buddy...">Chummer!</strong> welcome to the awful world of Shadowrun. Shadowrun is an alternate 
                    future in which cybernetics, magic and fantasy creatures co-exist.</p>
                <p>The end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ushered in the
                    "Sixth World", with once-mythological beings (e.g. dragons, ghouls and worse)
                    appearing and forms of magic suddenly emerging. Large numbers of
                    humans have "Goblinized" into orks and trolls, while many human
                    children are born as elves, dwarves, and even more exotic
                    creatures. Basically Magic, Neon and Cool ### Cybernetics</p>
                <p>...and hypercapitalism and other bad stuff we will promptly
                    ignore.</p>
                <p>Instead lets talk about the things that truly make Shadowrun -
                    Shadowrun.</p>

            <h2>Dracoforms</h2>
            <p>Dracoforms, also known as Dragons are the various forms of large saurian creatures of tremendous intellect and magical power. What little we know of these great mythical beasts comes from the great dragon Dunkelzahn, whose famous 12-hour interview on January 27th, 2012 answered most of the worldâ€™s questions about dragons, the Awakening and magic in general. Dunkelzahn, however, was an enigma among dragons. Whereas most dragons are solitary creatures, more apt to see people and companies as ways to increase their wealth and/or power, the Big D was always in the public spotlight and led metahumanity through the dark years when magic first returned. Most dragons can take on a human form in order to fit into modern society.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eastern Dragons</li>
                <li>Feathered Serpents</li>
                <li>Western Dragons</li>
                <li>Leviathans</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Great Dragons</h3>
            <p>Great Dragons are larger, stronger, more intelligent, and more magically powerful then their normal dracoform counterparts. They are capable of transforming in to metahuman form at will and the ability to twist fate itself (in game terms they're able to counter act edge). It is currently unknown if all dragons will become great dragons as a natural part of their life cycle, but as what little details are known when Masaru became a great dragon, there is a noticeable physical change to the dragon after the process occurs. The life cycle of dracoforms does seem to require great dragons, as great dragons are needed to raise dragon eggs. It does not matter who gave birth to the eggs, as for if the eggs stay under the care of a great dragon, the whelps that hatch will be the type of the great dragon. This is why the Sea Dragon worked for years to get her eggs back from Rhonabwy, as she did not want them to become western dragons.</p>
