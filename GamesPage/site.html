            <p>You ever completed a game and wished you could erase your memory
                and do it all again, experience the atmosphere, surprises and

            <h3>1993 - Shadowrun</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun is a cyberpunk-fantasy action role-playing video game
                for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, adapted from the
                tabletop role-playing game Shadowrun by FASA. The video game was
                developed by Australian company Beam Software and first released
                in 1993 by Data East.</p>
            <p>The game is loosely based on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon
                by Shadowrun co-creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year
                2050. The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a man
                suffering from amnesia after having been critically wounded by
                assassins. The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover
                his own identity and the identity of the mysterious figure who
                wants him dead, and eventually complete his mission. Harebrained
                Schemes' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the stories of this game
                and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1994 - Shadowrun</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun is an action role-playing game for the Sega Genesis,
                released in 1994 in North America and Asia only. It was adapted
                from the cyberpunk role-playing game Shadowrun by FASA, and was
                developed by BlueSky Software. The game is the second video game
                adapted from Shadowrun, and has a more open ended style of
                gameplay than its 1993 Super NES counterpart, Shadowrun by Beam
                Software.</p>
            <p>Shadowrun offers the player an open style of gameplay, where one
                controls the main character, Joshua, in a top-down third person
                perspective during both exploration and combat. Battles are real
                time, and although of varying difficulty, tend to be relatively
                short. Initially, the player is restricted to a single area of
                the game, but shortly gains access to almost all other areas.
                Access to other areas is accomplished primarily by taxi,
                although various restrictions and other modes of travel also
                exist, such as requiring a visa or bypassing the visa check with
                the use of a helicopter.</p>

            <h3>1996 - Shadowrun</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun (シャドウラン, Shadouran) is a cyberpunk visual novel
                role-playing video game for the Sega Mega-CD adapted from the
                Japanese version of the pen and paper RPG Shadowrun by FASA
                (which was created by Group SNE). It was developed by Japanese
                company Compile[3] and released on February 23, 1996 in Japan
                only as both the last Mega-CD game released in Japan and the
                last game released anywhere on the Mega-CD/Sega CD.</p>
            <p>The game has a 1990s manga-based visual style loosely based on a
                contemporary Japanese manga series which was based on the
                Shadowrun franchise. Unlike the other Shadowrun video games
                which are set in Seattle and surrounding areas, this game is set
                entirely in Japan. In the fictional Shadowrun setting, Japan
                maintains a practice of exiling all orcs and trolls; thus there
                are no characters of those races in this game. The combat system
                is turn-based, and six-sided dice appear rolling on the screen
                determine the results of combat—the conflict resolution system
                used in the Shadowrun table-top game.</p>

            <h3>2007 - Shadowrun</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun is a first-person shooter video game, developed by FASA
                Studio for Xbox 360 and Windows Vista. The game features a
                buying system which is inspired by the game Counter-Strike. The
                game is also inspired by the role-playing game of the same name.</p>
            <p>Shadowrun's multiplayer consisted wholly of a first person/third
                person deathmatch. Players chose various races with unique
                abilities. Additionally, a currency system dictated in-match
                upgrades, with each race given a different amount of starting
                capital. The four playable races are Human, Elf, Dwarf, and
                Troll. Magic was a key component to this game as well. Players
                could heal, damage, teleport, and summon to gain advantages over
                others. Additionally, gadgets, or "tech", were obtainable
                through currency. Currency also allowed players to purchase new
                weapons.</p>
            <p>Shadowrun featured no campaign mode. If a user was without online
                services, they could set up bot matches and hone their skills.</p>

            <h3>2013 - Shadowrun Returns</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun Returns is a tactical role-playing game developed and
                published by Harebrained Schemes. It takes place in the science
                fantasy setting of the Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game. The
                game was crowd funded through Kickstarter and released for
                Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android in 2013.</p>
            <p>An expansion pack titled Shadowrun: Dragonfall, was released in
                2014. It was later converted to a standalone release, Shadowrun:
                Dragonfall - Director's Cut. In 2015, Harebrained Schemes
                launched another Kickstarter campaign to partially fund their
                next game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong.[4] Similar to the Dragonfall -
                Director's Cut edition, Hong Kong was released in 2015 as a
                standalone release built using an upgraded version of the
                Shadowrun Returns engine. A remastered compilation game
                including Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun Dragonfall: Director's
                Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, is released on Windows, Nintendo
                Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
                X/S on June 21, 2022.</p>
            <h4>Gameplay</h4>
            <p>The player can customize their character's gender and appearance.
                There are five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves,
                orcs, and trolls. The game lacks traditional character classes,
                but players may optionally play as one of six pregenerated
                archetypes: street samurai, cybernetically-enhanced warriors who
                focus on weapon mastery; the spell-casting mages; deckers, who
                focus primarily on computer hacking; shamans, who summon spirits
                to assist them in battle; riggers, who control mechanical
                drones; and physical adepts, who are magically-enhanced monks.</p>
            <p>As the story progresses, the player is given character points,
                known as "karma", to spend on improving their characters. If the
                player chose an archetype, it controls what skills and equipment
                the character starts with, but any character can gain any skill
                (e.g., deckers can spend karma to gain a shaman's summoning
                abilities). Besides the player character, up to three other
                characters can be hired during missions. Some
                non-player-characters are required during certain missions.</p>

            <h3>2014 - Shadowrun: Dragonfall</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a tactical role-playing game developed
                by Harebrained Schemes set in the Shadowrun universe. It was
                originally released as downloadable content for Shadowrun
                Returns in February 2014. An expanded version was later released
                as a standalone game in September 2014, under the title
                Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut. A remastered compilation
                game titled Shadowrun Trilogy that includes Shadowrun Returns,
                Shadowrun Dragonfall: Director's Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong,
                launched on Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation
                5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on June 21, 2022.</p>
            <p>Like Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall uses point-based character
                creation, a classless system, and turn-based tactics.[2] Players
                can hire mercenaries to assist them during missions as in the
                previous game, but the player is a part of a preexisting team,
                and these characters are always available.[3] The Directors Cut
                adds optional missions to assist your teammates.</p>

            <h3>2015 - Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown (originally marketed as
                Shadowrun Online) was a turn-based tactical video game developed
                by Cliffhanger Productions and published by Nordic Games as part
                of Jordan Weisman's cyberpunk Shadowrun fictional universe.[4]
                With the servers shut down, the game stopped working on November
                30, 2018.</p>

            <h3>2015 - Shadowrun: Hong Kong</h3>
            <p>Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a turn-based tactical role-playing video
                game set in the Shadowrun universe. It was developed and
                published by Harebrained Schemes, who previously developed
                Shadowrun Returns and its standalone expansion, Shadowrun:
                Dragonfall - Director's Cut. It includes a new single-player
                campaign and also shipped with a level editor that lets players
                create their own Shadowrun campaigns and share them with other
                players.</p>
            <p>In January 2015, Harebrained Schemes launched a Kickstarter
                campaign in order to fund additional features and content they
                wanted to add to the game, but determined would not have been
                possible with their current budget.[3] The initial funding goal
                of US$100,000 was met in only a few hours.[4] The campaign ended
                the following month, receiving over $1.2 million.</p>
            <p>The game is set in 2056, within the Hong Kong Free Enterprise
                Zone, a city which is effectively controlled directly by the
                corporations. Unlike the previous games, the player has a
                backstory tied to other characters. The player was once an
                orphan on the streets of Seattle, along with their foster
                brother Duncan, when they were adopted by a man known as Raymond
                Black. However, the player became estranged from Raymond and
                Duncan after getting arrested and sent to a corporate prison
                eight years before the events of the game. After being released,
                the player gets a message from Raymond requesting that they and
                Duncan meet him in Hong Kong</p>
